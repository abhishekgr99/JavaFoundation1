Passing Objects as Arguments
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java is a Programming language -> Write a Program
Program -> Set of instructions given to a device
Programming Language -> We build instructions in English (High Level Language)
Compiler -> Converts HLL to LLL
Developer to Automate any Task:
1.	Understand the Syntax and Semantics of any programming language
2.	Create instructions following the rules
3.	Convert this HL to machine understandable language using compiler
4.	Ask the processer to execute the task
Java -> Founded by Sun Microsystems ( by James Gosling) -> This was built as Object Oriented PL

### Advantages of Java:
1. Simple and Object Oriented
2. Platform Independent ( Code Once Run Anywhere – CORA/WORA)
JDK -> Java Development Toolkit
JVM + Compiler + Runtime Library + Dev Tools
JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
JVM + Runtime Library
X.java -> Compile -> Byte Code (X.class) I cannot run this(Bytecode) -> Pass this to JVM(Interpretor)
Interpretor -> Converts high level byte code to lower level machine code and executes
Developer -> JDK (Write + Compile + Execute)
Client -> JRE (Execute) -> ( I will provide .class files)
Windows : (Developer)	Mac (Client)
X.java	x.class
Compiled	Executed
X.class	O/p for Mac
Executed	
O/p for Windows	

Platform Independent -> Compiled Program (Byte Code)
Platform Dependent -> JVM and Runtime Libraries
JDK and JRE -> PD Download OS Specific
3. Robust: Reliable -> Meet the requirement with lesser bugs
4. Multithreaded -> Performing multiple tasks at single time
5. I18N -> Internationalization

Java as Object Oriented Programming Language:
### 4 Pillars of Java:
•	Encapsulation
•	Inheritance
•	Polymorphism
•	Abstraction

Object: It is a thing which mimics the real world
Pen, Mobile, Car, Book etc…
Object has Properties and Behaviour
